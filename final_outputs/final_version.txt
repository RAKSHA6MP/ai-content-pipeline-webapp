## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick stood on a coral ledge, gazing south.  Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray blown inland by the wind. Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin—a vast, tranquil expanse of blue, dotted with fishing gulls.

Enclosed by a forty-mile coral reef, the lagoon was a sea unto itself: stormy in strong winds, a tranquil lake in gentler breezes.  And it was *his*. He'd only arrived yesterday.

The beach bustled with activity: women, children, and young people fished, played games, or worked on their patches of taro. They were his people now. The canoes pulled ashore, the empty houses that once held war canoes—all were his.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses. His brow furrowed. Turning his back to the calm water, he faced the crashing waves of the outer reef and the northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, unseen, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise in his dreams, yet a devil's lair in reality.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker's son, sat nearby on the coral, watching him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew the men of Karolin lost in war had left the women and children defenseless, leaderless.

Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed they were sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

Tari, unburdened by adult understanding, asked simply, “Taori, who are you?”

Could Dick have answered honestly? Could the child have understood his story?  He *could* have said: “Tari, I'm from a world far beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange.  When I was younger than you, I was stranded on the island you call Palm Tree (Marua) with an old sailor, Kearney. He taught me to fish, and made me toys—little ships, unlike your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the girl lost in the storm. After Kearney died, we escaped from Palm Tree in our boat, guided by the lagoon's light in the sky, to Karolin.”

But he couldn't. The name "Dick" and his childhood language were lost memories. Kearney was a fading figure in the hazy past. For those long shipwrecked, memories blur.  Dick's past only began when Katafa arrived at Marua; before that was a blank, swallowed by the island's intense light, storms, and rainy seasons. Only the little ships Kearney had made kept the old man's memory alive.

He looked down at the child. "I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," the child replied. "I ask as I breathe, but grown-ups never answer my questions… Look, fish!"  His attention shifted to children hauling in a net, and he ran off.

Dick's gaze returned to the north.  The child's question stirred him. He saw again the schooner at Palm Tree, burned by the Melanesians. He saw his escape with Katafa. He saw their arrival on this beach, the people crowding around their new, god-sent leader.

The memory of his escape stained the beauty of the sea and sky.  He wasn't immediately afraid of the men who'd taken Palm Tree; they had no canoes. But they *would* build canoes. They *would* see the reflection of Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.

Dick was essentially a native, yet the white man remained within him. He could think strategically, imagine consequences.

That morning he'd sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old men, past fighting age, but skilled canoe builders.  He'd noticed nearly a hundred young men approaching fighting age.  Underlying everything, fueling his courage, was his love for Katafa—a love threatened, however vaguely.

War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon? Or attack first?  It was unclear.

A hand touched his shoulder.  Katafa stood beside him, a strand of dark hair escaping its vine binding, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous dark eyes weren't on him, but fixed on the north—the direction of Palm Tree.

"Look!" she said.

Under certain conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible through mirage. They had seen it last night, and now again it appeared—a hazy smudge low in the sky, growing clearer, until the island emerged, dreamlike yet vivid.

Hand on shoulder, they stood silently, their untutored minds unaware of mirage, their eyes fixed on their escape route, now strangely reappearing.

They saw again the savage horde, monstrous figures like nightmares. They felt the wind in their sail as they fled, heard the yells of the drunken Melanesians. There, before them, was the scene of their trauma, its beauty masking the demons within.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkening with hatred. They had threatened him, but threatening Katafa was everything.  And the threat remained.

Someday they would come. Palm Tree’s reappearance confirmed his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and come.  They had no women; Karolin had many. He sensed the same draw that had brought him to Katafa would bring them to Karolin's women. They would search for a raidable island, see the lagoon light, and come.

Danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed and hatred roamed, not only amongst savages but also civilized "wolves."

Dick knew only the world of water surrounding the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but his own and Katafa's.  Even in their short lives, he’d learned to fear men, to understand the foundation of all history: man's instinct for war and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded, vanished. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe from the south.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked to the beach to meet it.
