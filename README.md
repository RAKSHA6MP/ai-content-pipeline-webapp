# ai-content-pipeline-webapp
A Flask-based AI-powered web application for rewriting, reviewing, storing, and searching text content using Google Gemini and vector embeddings.
This project is a smart content processing pipeline that streamlines the rewriting, reviewing, and versioning of book chapters using Google Gemini AI and a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) mechanism. It combines AI writing assistance, vector-based semantic search, and a simple Flask-based web interface to support human feedback and traceability in automated text generation workflows.

The project is designed to be part of an automated book publication workflow, particularly useful for:

Editors rewriting older literary content into modern English

Writers seeking AI-assisted drafts with human review

Systems that require traceable, searchable, and editable AI-generated text
